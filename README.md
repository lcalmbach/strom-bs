# strom-bs
The app [Strom-bs](https://lcalmbach-strom-bs-app-6sfs1t.streamlit.app/) visualizes electricity consumption of the canton of Basel-Stadt, based on fifteen minutes interval consumption data from [data.bs](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100233). This app is written in Python using the Framework [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).The aim of the application is to check whether electricity consumption has been decreasing starting mid-2022. Because of the Ukrainian war crisis a potential electricity bottleneck was predicted for the coming winter of 2023.
