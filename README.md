Electricity consumption of the canton of Basel-Stadt, based on quarter of an hour consumption data from [Opendate.bs](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100233). This app is written in Python using the Framework [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).The aim of the application is to check whether electricity consumption has been decreasing starting mid 2022. Because of the Ucranian war crisis a potential electricity bottleneck was predicted for the coming winter 2023.
